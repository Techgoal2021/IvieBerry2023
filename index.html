        <br>
        Lately I've been wondering <br>
        Wondering where you go <br>
        Lately I don't feel you anymore <br>
        <br>
        Come on now let me in <br>
        Come on now give me hope <br>
        Darling I can't wait for you no more <br>
        <br>
        But the truth remains you're haunting this place <br>
        Haunting this space in my head <br>
        And it hurts to know you've taken my soul <br> And I
        Should let you go but I can't <br>
        <br>
        
        So ooh <br>
        Tell me where you've been love <br>
        Oh, no <br>
        Tell me where you've been 'cause I've been lonely <br>
        Tell me where to go 'cause I've been stalling <br>
        Oh, oh <br>
        Tell me where you've been love <br>
        Oh, no <br>
        Lately I know I've been <br>
        Know I've been someone else <br>
        Lately I don't recognize myself <br>
        <br>
        
        Come on now let it go <br>
        Come on love don't you see <br>
        We're getting to our world <br>
        And I don't wanna breathe with no one else <br>
        <br>
        
        So ooh <br>
        Tell me where you've been love <br>
        Oh, no <br>
        Oh, no <br>
        Tell me where you been 'cause I've been lonely <br>
        Oh, oh <br>
        Tell me where to go 'cause I've been stalling <br>
        Oh, no, oh <br>
        Tell me where you've been love <br>
        Oh, no <br>
        Tell me where you've been love <br>
        And tell me where you've been love <br>
